##Lattice Ising Model

A given code was found to numerically estimate temperature of a phase transition betwenn a two-dimensional ferromagnetic Ising model on a triangular lattice including the nearest neighbor interactions. The code was then modified from the triangular lattice to a rectangular one by adjusting the code from using 4 neighbors to 6 while also increasing the energy states. It is then demonstrates that the critical temperature for phase transitions of a two-dimenstional Ising model on a triangular lattice is dimensionless.
